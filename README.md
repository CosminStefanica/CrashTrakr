# CrashTrakr

CrashTrakr is a test data retrieval tool built to work together with Jenkins test automation projects.
Should work on python 3.0 or greater
Prerequisites: psutil, matplotlib

Based on a .json config file, it will pull test results from your jenkins server and display them fullscreen using matplotlib.

At the moment it does not work without a config file, and is only configured to display three projects. Additional functionality will be added in time.
